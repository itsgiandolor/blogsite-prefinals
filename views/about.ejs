        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Gian Dolor. I'm a 20-year-old student at Ateneo de Naga University, where I am majoring in BS Information Technology. If you’re reading this, welcome to my little corner of the internet!</p>

        <p>When I’m not coding away in my room or studying for exams, you can find me doing a variety of things — ranging from exploring new places, working out, getting lost in my thoughts at 2 AM, or binge-watching random documentaries on YouTube.</p>

        <h2>Random Facts About Me:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I believe coffee is the fuel that powers the universe. No, seriously, I can’t survive a day without it.</li>
            <li>I'm obsessed with learning new programming languages. Currently, I’m diving deep into Python and Web Development.</li>
            <li>I’m an introvert who occasionally loves playing multiplayer games. (Hit me up for some epic gaming sessions!)</li>
            <li>My favorite hobby is cycling — it’s my therapy. The wind in my hair, the road beneath me... pure freedom.</li>
            <li>If I had a superpower, it would be the ability to teleport anywhere at will. Imagine never having to sit in traffic again!</li>
            <li>Fun fact: I once accidentally made a website look like a disco party. Let’s just say, it was... colorful!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Goals & Ambitions:</h2>
        <p>My main goal right now is to learn as much as I can about technology and how it can solve real-world problems. I want to work on projects that have a positive impact on people’s lives. And, maybe one day, I’ll build something cool enough to make my mom proud.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests:</h2>
        <p>I love diving into new hobbies, whether it's photography, trying out new recipes (my pasta is legendary), or just going on spontaneous adventures. I’m a firm believer in trying everything at least once, and if it sticks, I’m hooked!</p>

        <h2>Random Thoughts:</h2>
        <p>Here’s a random thought: Sir Agawagodz best prof ever!</p>

        <h2>Why I Started This Blog:</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve had this urge to document everything. Be it an experience, a thought, or just a moment of inspiration. This blog is my creative outlet where I can express myself freely. And, maybe, inspire others along the way!</p>
